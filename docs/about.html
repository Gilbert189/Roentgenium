        <h3><em>A bot for the TBGs</em></h3>
        <br /><br />
        <p><em>Nihonium</em> is a bot made for <a href="https://tbgforums.com/forums/">the TBG forums</a>, designed to be able to parse input and give responses.</p>
        <br />
        <p>...that's might not sound impressive, until you realize that the TBGs don't have any sort of API; the bot uses raw HTTP requests to recieve input and send output.</p>
        <br />
        <p>It's currently in early development, meaning that things can change at any time, so you shouldn't expect something to work the same way it does currently after a month, a few weeks, or even a few days.</p>
        <br /><br />
