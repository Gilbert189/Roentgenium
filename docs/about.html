        <h3><em>A bot for the TBGs, round 2</em></h3>
        <br /><br />
        <p><em>Roentgenium</em> is a fork of <em>Nihonium</em>, a bot made for <a href="https://tbgforums.com/forums/">the TBG forums</a>, before it's killed off when the TBGs migrated to Simple Machine Forums.</p>
        <br />
        <p>Like its predecessor, it's currently in early development (especially since it's in the middle of being rewritten), meaning that things, <b>especially the framework,</b> can change at any time. You shouldn't expect something to work the same way it does currently after a month, a few weeks, or even a few days.</p>
        <br /><br />
